- The robot simulator CoppeliaSim is based on a distributed control architecture: each object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS or BlueZero node, a remote API client, or a custom solution. This makes CoppeliaSim very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave.

- CoppeliaSim is used for fast algorithm development, factory automation simulations, fast prototyping and verification, robotics related education, remote monitoring, safety double-checking, as digital twin, and much more. You can find a features of CoppeliaSim [Over Here](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/features).

- It can be used as a stand-alone application or can easily be embedded into a main client application: its small footprint and elaborate API makes CoppeliaSim an ideal candidate to embed into higher-level applications.
