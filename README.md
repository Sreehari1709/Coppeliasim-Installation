Hi Everyone !
Welcome you to very new petal of Shaastra.....
Our Science & Technology is emerging day by day and the horizon of Knowledge and Innovation of mankind is getting vast, and in the comming future it's gonna be a fact that not only human going to work for his race but also new machines **"Robots"** will also join with us. They will be providing us many help in doing our and repetitative work easily and quickly , they will be providing a way for us to move ahead with a pace in comming future. So before that how they will be able to us , they needs to be self sufficient to do many things by there on... How they will be able to do that ...? How they will be able to find their own path...? 
Hmm.. that story will be interesting right!.

We welcome you to be module of **Build Your Own Autonomous Robot** module to know some glimpses of the vast field and get some taste of it....
<hr>

For our module you needs to be equiped with some softwares like CoppeliaSim , Matlab (better to have, but not mondatory)..
Inorder to setup CoppeliaSim in your system go through the instructions given below ...
##  CoppeliaSim 4.2.0-Installation

- The robot simulator CoppeliaSim is based on a distributed control architecture: each object/model can be individually controlled via an embedded script, a plugin, a ROS or BlueZero node, a remote API client, or a custom solution. This makes CoppeliaSim very versatile and ideal for multi-robot applications. Controllers can be written in C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, Matlab or Octave.

- CoppeliaSim is used for fast algorithm development, factory automation simulations, fast prototyping and verification, robotics related education, remote monitoring, safety double-checking, as digital twin, and much more. You can find a features of CoppeliaSim [Over Here](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/features).

- It can be used as a stand-alone application or can easily be embedded into a main client application: its small footprint and elaborate API makes CoppeliaSim an ideal candidate to embed into higher-level applications.
- To get some glimpses you can also watch the [videos](https://coppeliarobotics.com/videos).

### For Windows Users

**Note** : Incase if Windows defender is not allowing CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_Setup.exe to run then download the [binary files](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/files/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_Win.zip) 

### For Ubuntu Users

- Download CoppeliaSim Edu 4.2.0 for **Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit OS** from [here](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/files/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_Ubuntu18_04.tar.xz) (file size - 148MB). It will download as .tar.xz (compressed zip) file.

- Download CoppeliaSim for **Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit OS**, click here 1 (file size - 145MB).

Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where this file was downloaded. Run the following command:

***tar -xf CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_Ubuntu18_04.tar.xz***

This command will decompress and extract the CoppeliaSim software to the folder named CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_Ubuntu18_04 in the same directory.

Now type the below commands in sequence to launch CoppeliaSim.

***cd CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_Ubuntu18_04
./coppeliaSim.sh***

- Now you will be able see the window as shown in the image above

### For macOS Users

- Download CoppeliaSim Edu 4.2.0 for **macOS** from [here](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/files/CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_2_0_macOS10_15.zip)
- Unzip the downloaded file and move the unzipped file to Applications as shown in figure below :

![Image 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saurabhcosmos/milkyway/main/images/cop4.png)
- Now open terminal and run following commands:

cd /Applications/coppeliaSim.app

sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine *
